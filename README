tone_generator
--------------

This is a tone generator. It is a pure ISO C 2017 program that takes mathematical functions
and outputs waveforms from them.

The original purpose was to learn what Bessel functions "sounded like": it
turns out elliptic integrals are more interesting.

It compiles with

    gcc audio.c -lgsl -lm

The output waveforms are in a standard PCM format and can be played as audio 
(e.g. with aplay): signed 16-bit little-endian samples at a 44.1kHz sample rate,
with 2 channels (stereo).

    ./a.out | aplay -f cd

They can also be saved to raw WAV files very easily:

    ./a.out > output.raw

And opened in e.g. Audacity.

They can also be converted to other formats with ffmpeg as long as the sample
format and bitrate are specified:

    ffmpeg -f s16le -ar 44.1k -ac 2 -i besseljs_n0to25.raw besseljs_n0to25.mp3
